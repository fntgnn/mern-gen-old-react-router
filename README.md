### Express generator with react and redux
This is (for me) the boiler template that I need for building apps for the challenges from Free Code Camp (dinamic web applications).

I used react, react-router, redux, axios and there are little examples of all I need to manipulate in a correct way the state with redux.

#### Getting started
1. Clone the repository
2. install the modules: `npm install`
3. create a `.env` file with the path of the database:
```
DB_URI = mongodb://yourdatabase
```
4. Open two terminals:
  1. `npm start` or `nodemon`
  2. `webpack -w`

Feel free to contact me if you have any question or suggestions
